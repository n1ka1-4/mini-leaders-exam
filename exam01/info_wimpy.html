        <br>Filled with laugh-out-loud hilarious text and cartoons,
        <br>follows Greg Heffley
        <br>as he records the daily trials and triumphs of friendship,
        <br>family life and middle school where undersized weaklings have to share the hallways
        <br>with kids who are taller, meaner and already shaving!
